# Solar Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves the collection, analysis, and visualization of solar irradiation and output data from the PVGIS system across various geographical locations, with a focus on areas near Chennai. The goal is to gain insights into the feasibility of different photovoltaic (PV) technologies in specific regions.

## Project Scope

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Web scraped and manually loaded data points from the PVGIS system.
   - Chose locations near Chennai for detailed analysis.

2. **Data Analysis and Cleaning:**
   - Performed thorough data analysis to identify patterns and trends.
   - Employed data cleaning techniques to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Created visualizations to illustrate behaviors and variations in the solar data.
   - Utilized graphs and charts to represent the data effectively.

4. **Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Conducted statistical analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
   - Formulated hypotheses and performed testing to determine the suitability of different PV technologies for specific geographical locations.

## Key Findings

1. **Geographical Variation:**
   - Identified significant geographical variations in solar irradiation and output.
   - Mapped out regions with optimal solar conditions.

2. **PV Technology Suitability:**
   - Formulated conclusions on which types of PV technology are most suitable for different locations.
   - Considered factors such as efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental conditions.
